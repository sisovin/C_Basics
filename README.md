# C PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE

## C Overview
C is a general purpose, statically typed, imperative programming language that was founded in 1972 by Dennis Ritchie and Ken Thompson at Bell Laboratories.

C is a low-level language meaning it provides constructs which map efficiently to typical machine instructions. Basically, it’s a more user-friendly way to write low-level programs. Instead of pulling your hair out writing low-level code in an assembly language, you can abstract a lot of the fuss and write equivalent programs in C.

Because it’s so low-level, many operating system kernels, and even other programming languages are implemented at least in part, using C. And many modern programming languages today borrow syntax and best practices from C.

## How C Runs
All C programs must utilize a compiler whose job is to compile the C code down into machine code readable by the computer. So anytime you want to run a C program you have to compile it first.

C relies on the user to manage the program’s memory, and the syntax of C is largely influenced by the B programming language.

## Choosing an IDE
Many developers choose to write C using a basic text editor, but there are also more specialized integrated development environments, some of the most popular include Code Blocks, Eclipse, and NetBeans. For me, I like to use Visual Studio Code for my C programming.

## How to Compile and Run a C Program on Windows

### Prerequisites

- Ensure you have `gcc` installed. You can install it using MinGW or MSYS2.
- If `gcc` is not recognized in PowerShell, add its path to the system's PATH environment variable.

#### Downloading MSYS2 and MinGW

- **MSYS2**: Download from [MSYS2 website](https://www.msys2.org/).
- **MinGW**: Download from [MinGW website](http://www.mingw.org/).

#### Adding `gcc` to PATH

1. Open the Start Menu and search for "Environment Variables".
2. Click on "Edit the system environment variables".
3. In the System Properties window, click on the "Environment Variables" button.
4. In the Environment Variables window, find the "Path" variable in the "System variables" section and select it. Click "Edit".
5. Click "New" and add the path to the `bin` directory of your MSYS2 installation (e.g., `D:\msys64\mingw64\bin`).
6. Click "OK" to close all windows.

After adding the path, open a new PowerShell window and try running `gcc --version` again.

### Steps to Compile and Run

1. **Navigate to the Directory**:
   Open your terminal (PowerShell or Command Prompt) and navigate to the directory where your `hello.c` file is located:

   ```powershell
   cd D:\CGroupProjects\C_Basics\Printing
   ```

2. **Compile the C Program**:
   Use the `gcc` command to compile your C program:

   ```powershell
   gcc hello.c -o hello
   ```

3. **Run the Executable**:
   After compilation, run the generated executable file:

   ```powershell
   .\hello.exe
   ```

   You should see the following output:

   ```
   Hello
   World!
   ```

### Compiling and Running Another Program

To compile `variables.c` and place the executable in a debug directory, you can specify the output path when using `gcc`. Here are the steps:

1. Create the debug directory if it doesn't exist:

   ```powershell
   mkdir debug
   ```

2. Compile the `variables.c` file and specify the output path:

   ```powershell
   gcc variables/variables.c -o debug/variables.exe
   ```

3. Run the executable from the debug directory:

   ```powershell
   .\debug\variables.exe
   ```

This will compile the `variables.c` file and place the resulting `variables.exe` in the debug
 directory, then run it from there.

## Writing a Simple C Program

Create a new file named `simple.c` and add the following code:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    printf("This is a simple C program.\n");
    return 0;
}
```

Save the file and follow the steps to compile and run it.

## Debugging a C Program

1. **Compile with Debug Information**:
   Use the `-g` flag to include debug information in the executable:

   ```powershell
   gcc -g hello.c -o hello
   ```

2. **Run the Debugger**:
   Use `gdb` to debug the executable:

   ```powershell
   gdb hello
   ```

3. **Set Breakpoints and Run**:
   Inside `gdb`, set breakpoints and run the program:

   ```gdb
   (gdb) break main
   (gdb) run
   ```

4. **Step Through the Code**:
   Use commands like `next` and `step` to step through the code:

   ```gdb
   (gdb) next
   (gdb) step
   ```

## Adding the Project to GitHub

1. **Initialize a Git Repository**:
   Navigate to the root directory of your project and initialize a Git repository:

   ```powershell
   cd D:\CGroupProjects\C_Basics
   git init
   ```

2. **Add Files to the Repository**:
   Add all files to the repository:

   ```powershell
   git add .
   ```

3. **Commit the Files**:
   Commit the files with a message:

   ```powershell
   git commit -m "Initial commit"
   ```

4. **Add Remote Repository**:
   Add the remote repository URL:

   ```powershell
   git remote add origin https://github.com/sisovin/C_Basics.git
   ```

5. **Push to GitHub**:
   Push the files to the remote repository:

   ```powershell
   git push -u origin master
   ```

## Troubleshooting

- **`gcc` Not Recognized**:
  Ensure `gcc` is installed and added to your system's PATH environment variable.

- **File Not Found**:
  Ensure you are in the correct directory where `hello.c` is located.

- **No Output**:
  Ensure your `hello.c` file includes the correct code:

  ```c
  #include <stdio.h>

  int main() {
      printf("Hello\n");
      printf("World");
      printf("!\n");
      return 0;
  }
  ```

By following these steps, you should be able to compile, run, debug, and push your C programs to GitHub successfully.
